I'm watching the first episode of <a title="BBC - The Genius of Design" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sdb8x" target="_blank">The Genius of Design</a>, a BBC documentary series exploring the history of design. It's not about <em>software</em> design, but one could argue that the <em>process </em>and the <em>craft </em>of design are interesting not matter <em>what</em> is being designed. Anyway. They briefly interview <a title="Dieter Rams - Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams" target="_blank">Dieter Rams</a>, a very prolific designer who made the history of industrial design and came up with ten commandments. Read them slowly. The 10th is pure genius.<a href="http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cad-drawing-540.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-565" style="border: 0; opacity: 0.5;" title="cad-drawing-540" src="http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cad-drawing-540-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="200" /></a>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>(We are grateful to Mr Rams for such pearls of wisdom, </em><em><a title="1960s Braun Products Hold the Secrets to Apple's Future" href="http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future" target="_blank">and so is apple...</a>)</em></p>
All this talk about design reminds me of  <a title="Amazon.co.uk - The Design of Everyday Things" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107" target="_blank">the design of everyday things</a>. It's a brilliant book, inspiring and foundational. I keep suggesting it, especially to programmers and makers alike. <a href="http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/design_everyday_things.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-555" title="the design of everyday things - cover" src="http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/design_everyday_things.png" alt="the design of everyday things - cover" width="79" height="118" /></a>Another title worth mentioning is <a title="amazon.co.uk - the design of design" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Essays-Computer-Scientist/dp/0201362988" target="_blank">the design of design</a>, from the same folk who wrote "the mythical man-month". The new book is not as ground-breaking as the old one, but it's a good read of its own right.

On the subject of <em>exploring </em>and <em>finding</em> a design, watch this video on ted: <a title="TED.com - Tom Wujec: Build a tower, build a team" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower.html" target="_blank">build a tower, build a team</a> (6 minutes).

<em>Is there something like imdb or wikipedia for books? I keep linking amazon but I'd prefer to link to a website with a more informational angle.</em>
