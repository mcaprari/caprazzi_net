I'm watching the first episode of [The Genius of Design](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sdb8x "BBC - The Genius of Design"), a BBC documentary series exploring the history of design. It's not about _software_ design, but one could argue that the _process _and the _craft _of design are interesting not matter _what_ is being designed. Anyway. They briefly interview [Dieter Rams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams "Dieter Rams - Wikipedia"), a very prolific designer who made the history of industrial design and came up with ten commandments. Read them slowly. The 10th is pure genius.[![](http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cad-drawing-540-150x150.jpg "cad-drawing-540")](http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/cad-drawing-540.jpg)<style type="text/css"> .entry ol li { color:black;} </style>1.

7. Good design is long-lasting
8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail

10. Good design is **as little design as possible**

_(We are grateful to Mr Rams for such pearls of wisdom, __[and so is apple...](http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future "1960s Braun Products Hold the Secrets to Apple's Future"))_
All this talk about design reminds me of  [the design of everyday things](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0465067107 "Amazon.co.uk - The Design of Everyday Things"). It's a brilliant book, inspiring and foundational. I keep suggesting it, especially to programmers and makers alike. [![the design of everyday things - cover](http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/design_everyday_things.png "the design of everyday things - cover")](http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/design_everyday_things.png)Another title worth mentioning is [the design of design](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Essays-Computer-Scientist/dp/0201362988 "amazon.co.uk - the design of design"), from the same folk who wrote "the mythical man-month". The new book is not as ground-breaking as the old one, but it's a good read of its own right.<br /><br />On the subject of _exploring _and _finding_ a design, watch this video on ted: [build a tower, build a team](http://www.ted.com/talks/tom_wujec_build_a_tower.html "TED.com - Tom Wujec: Build a tower, build a team") (6 minutes).<br />_Is there something like imdb or wikipedia for books? I keep linking amazon but I'd prefer to link to a website with a more informational angle._<div><span style="color: #0000ee; -webkit-text-decorations-in-effect: underline;"></span></div>
