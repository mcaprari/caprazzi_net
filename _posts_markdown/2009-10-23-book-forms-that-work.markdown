[Forms that Work: Designing Web Forms for Usability](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1558607102?ie=UTF8&tag=mattcapr-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1558607102)There is no html in this book, it's not about _programming_ forms. And that's why I liked it.This short book clarifies what good form design is about, in plain english. Plenty of images help, too.I'm still not too good at designing forms but at least now I know the name of the game.-teo[![forms_that_work](http://caprazzi.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/forms_that_work.jpg "forms_that_work")](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1558607102?ie=UTF8&tag=mattcapr-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1558607102)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=mattcapr-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1558607102)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=mattcapr-21&l=as2&o=2&a=1558607102)
