Programming books are seldom page turners, even for geeks like us. And programming books often fail to go beyond the technology. Programming books are rarely as good as this one. Allow me to digress for a moment.Online there is a lot of data about you. And me. Our reactions have been logged, our desires noted. You know where I am now. I know your status. Ok, I'm being dramatic, but bear with me. I have a point.All this data tells one story and million stories in their gritty details.

Curious about genetic programming? Wanna have your own spam filter?The last great thing about this book are the example. Real world, not your usual fictional pet shop. You'll fetch data from your delicious account, correlate live stock market data from yahoo, analyze your favorite blogs and more stuff.Tony writing is unpretentious and the book is easy to read, but beware there is a lot of meat to digest. Don't rush.
